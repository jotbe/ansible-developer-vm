# Fill in your usernames and passwords.
# vault_gituser: <git user>
# vault_gitpassword: <git password>

# If You'd like to use a vault, do the following:
# 1. Create a file group_vars/vault
# 2. Move the lines 2+3 to the vault (uncommented)
# 3. ansible-vault encrypt /path/to/vault and enter a password
# 4. Optionally: type the password into a file called vaultpassword, place it next to the playbook.yml
#       as a result, the provisioning will not ask you for the vaultpassword. Since this blueprint is for
#       provisioning developer vms, that should not be a problem and is done simply for automation. This 
#       strategy is probably not the best on systems you don't know all accesses.
# 5. Comment out the following lines.
vault_gituser: 
vault_gitpassword:
